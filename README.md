Hyphae
=============

Hyphae is an algorithm I wrote in an attempt to mimick the growth of roots.
The algorithm centers around letting circles grow "next to each other" in
such a way that no two circles overlap. The results are incredibly 
intricate and fractal-like, and they can be tweaked in a great number of
ways.
